# Comparative Analysis of Subgenomic RNA Profiles across SARS-CoV-2 lineages in Hong Kong
**Authors**: Tao Zhang, Haogao Gu, Leo L. M. Poon*

## Summary
### Background
Subgenomic RNAs (sgRNAs) are crucial to SARS-CoV-2 replication, but their lineage-specific profiles and clinical significance remain poorly understood. Hong Kong's elimination strategy prior to Omicron resulted in a largely infection-naive population, providing a unique context to study intrinsic viral sgRNA programs across lineages.
### Methods
We analyzed 5,867 deep-sequenced SARS-CoV-2 clinical samples collected in Hong Kong (2020–2022) spanning major lineages (20A, 20B, Alpha, Delta, Omicron BA.1/BA.2/BA.4/BA.5/XBB). We assessed sgRNA kinetics, associations with symptom status, and mutational patterns using integrated genomic and clinical data.

### Findings
Distinct sgRNA expression profiles were observed across lineages. Omicron variants exhibited significantly elevated structural protein sgRNAs and rapid early-peaking kinetics compared to sustained replication in earlier lineages. Associations between sgRNA levels and symptomatic infection shifted between vaccination eras: pre-vaccination, only elevated ORF8 sgRNA was linked to symptomatic outcomes (OR 1.127, 95% CI 1.025–1.251, p = 0.018); post-vaccination, S (OR 1.121, 95% CI 1.031–1.223, p = 0.009), ORF7a (OR 1.116, 95% CI 1.038–1.2, p = 0.003) and ORF8 (OR 1.242, 95% CI 1.059–1.484, p = 0.011) sgRNAs were significant in the Omicron incfected cases. Mutational analysis identified a prevalent C27889T mutation in the ORF8 TRS-B motif in Omicron BA.5, associated with markedly reduced ORF8 sgRNA. Additionally, a methodological artifact masquerading as a lineage-specific non-canonical sgRNA in BA.1 was identified.

### Interpretation
SARS-CoV-2 lineages exhibit lineage- and mutation-specific sgRNA transcriptional programs, reflecting adaptation to host immunity and potential impacts on transmissibility and pathogenesis. These findings underscore the importance of monitoring sgRNA profiles to evaluate emerging potential variants of concern.
